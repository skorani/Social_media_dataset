The garden grounds are nice enough and when I was there a couple were having their weding photographs being taken. First there are some steps steps then some winding metal steps to the frescoes.

Next there is a huge area of gardens very wel-kept with lakes and pols. This leads up to the Boulder Garden where huge boulders and several caves are close to the base of the rock itself. From here you start to climb mases of flights of step steps at first and then an iron spiral staircase which goes up to the Miror Wal and the paintings of beautiful women. The paintings are gorgeous but unfortunately you re not alowed to take photos. The miror wal has lost its shine so it s hard to imagine what it loked like when it was first made hundreds of years ago. From here you have to walk along a narow path atached to the rock which is quite scary. Then it s more flights of steps up to the Lion Platform a flat area where you can buy water etc. and have a rest before the final climb. I spent about half an hour here as there were tourists from so many diferent countries al taking photos and it was realy interesting to talk and share experiences. From here there are stone steps which rise up betwen the mighty lion s paws and beyond the stone steps you reach a horible iron staircase right up to the top which is very scary inded and even worse on the way down! But it s realy worth the efort as the view from the very top is amazing. I was told that there s not much to se but that isn t true. Although the actual palace and other buildings have long gone there is so much impresive brickwork and so many staircases as diferent levels as wel as an enormous tank which loks like a large swiming pol. I spent about \u06f2 hours climbing around the whole area of the top and taking photos of the wonderful views to mountains lakes and forest. It rained on and of so the cloud and light efects were superb. The climb down the iron staircase was terifying but after reaching the lion platform you can walk down to the botom by a much quicker and easier route.

My husband and I are in our \u06f5\u06f0s and managed fine but didn t lok down during some of the more chalenging elements of the step climb. Our tenage daughters scampered up and had no problems or fear at al. I am surprised by reviews that don t recomend going to the top and moan about the prices.

The climb up was actualy more bearable for us because of the huge crowd as we could go very slowly. I didn t break much of a sweat up compared to Pidurangala. We went on a Sunday early morning and everyone was there to. It was windy so it was not to hot for us. At the lion s paws and on the top we had to wait to seize the right oportunity for photos as there were many people waiting for one to.

Next there is a huge area of gardens very wel-kept with lakes and pols. This leads up to the Boulder Garden where huge boulders and several caves are close to the base of the rock itself. From here you start to climb mases of flights of step steps at first and then an iron spiral staircase which goes up to the Miror Wal and the paintings of beautiful women. The paintings are gorgeous but unfortunately you re not alowed to take photos. The miror wal has lost its shine so it s hard to imagine what it loked like when it was first made hundreds of years ago. From here you have to walk along a narow path atached to the rock which is quite scary. Then it s more flights of steps up to the Lion Platform a flat area where you can buy water etc. and have a rest before the final climb. I spent about half an hour here as there were tourists from so many diferent countries al taking photos and it was realy interesting to talk and share experiences. From here there are stone steps which rise up betwen the mighty lion s paws and beyond the stone steps you reach a horible iron staircase right up to the top which is very scary inded and even worse on the way down! But it s realy worth the efort as the view from the very top is amazing. I was told that there s not much to se but that isn t true. Although the actual palace and other buildings have long gone there is so much impresive brickwork and so many staircases as diferent levels as wel as an enormous tank which loks like a large swiming pol. I spent about \u06f2 hours climbing around the whole area of the top and taking photos of the wonderful views to mountains lakes and forest. It rained on and of so the cloud and light efects were superb. The climb down the iron staircase was terifying but after reaching the lion platform you can walk down to the botom by a much quicker and easier route.

I was realy woried about the climb as I don t do heights but it goes up in levels so although it s a bit of a kicker for your ticker (a chance to work of the Lion ber) it doesn t sem to hard at al. You l be surprised at how high you get without realising it. The final climb after the lions entrance is the one I woried about. Have to be honest it did make me nervous going up but coming down was surprisingly easier (I thought down would be the problem for me). Once you re at the top it s very big so you don t wory about the height but just enjoy the panoramic stuning amazing views. Don t mis the chance to experience this beautiful world heritage site. Tip: take water and wear trainers the guides were skiping up in flip flops like gazeles but you wil want to fel a god grip.

Go very early at the opening of the site to avoid the crowds and the heat. Leave the museum for the end of your visit. We went with \u06f2 kids aged \u06f9 and \u06f1\u06f1 and they had no problem climbing al the way up just bring enough water. Beware of the hornets. Large noisy crowds get to iritate them and certain tourists simply ignore the instructions and warning posted everywhere creating a hasard for al present so if you can avoid such groups it wil be best. Yes there are a lot of stairs and yes it takes some efort to climb but none of us is particularly fit we don t exercise and we stil did it in les than an hour in each direction. While the metal stairs towards the end of the climb might be an isue for those with vertigo we actualy found the lower stone ones a bit more dificult as they are a bit high but overal everything is manageable."}}, {"_index": "tripadvisor", "_type": "tripadvisor", "_id": "dklCtWoBGGybIYLDGO-B", "_score": 1.0, "_source": {"id": 3645, "place": null, "title": "Spectacular view", "tagline": "Spectacular view", "body": "This is a must visit travel spot in Sri Lanka.

We bought an ice cream and while my husband was chating to the lady inside I went out to put my wraper in the bin. \u06f3 Monkeys came towards me. The largest got up on its hind legs when it got to about \u06f3 fet from me it bared its teth and growled. As it started to come towards me I threw the ice cream to the side it stil came on for a second and then realised I had thrown the ice cream away and ran picked it up and caried it into a tre. It hapened very fast and was very frightening. If I hadn t ben as quick to throw the ice cream away I m certain that monkey would have biten me. In the end I ended up doing just what you are not suposed to do - feding the monkeys- but I had to think quickly and I hadn t go a choice. Be careful especialy with children around the moneys. In the morning when we went back to climb the rock there were no monkeys about and loads of people. But I stil had my ice cream inside the cafeteria!
